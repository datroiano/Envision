For the general same-day straddle idea:

1. Get earnings calendar based on various filters and parameters (namely dates and report hour)
2. Use a cleaning algorithm to get rid of tickers that will not conform to becoming Stock objects
3. Reduce the size of the data based on "max companies"
4. Use this list to create stock objects and get averages prices (*eventually to aggregate bars for machine learning)
